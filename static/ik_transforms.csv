* More error-prone than `x,y`
* Affected by image auto-rotation metadata

## yc

* Works **only with `cm-extract`**
* Requires **both `w` and `h`**
* Defines center of extraction, not the edge
* Crop fails if centered area exceeds image bounds
* More error-prone than `x,y`
* Affected by image auto-rotation metadata",crop,image,"**x**
Specifies the horizontal position of the **top-left corner** of the extracted area from the original image.

**y**
Specifies the vertical position of the **top-left corner** of the extracted area from the original image.

**xc**
Specifies the horizontal position of the **center point** of the extracted area from the original image.

**yc**
Specifies the vertical position of the **center point** of the extracted area from the original image.","---

## x (with y)

### This example shows extraction starting from a fixed top-left point

```python
tx = ResizeAndCropTransforms().resize_and_crop(
    width=300,
    height=300,
    crop_mode=""extract"",
    x=100,
    y=300
)
```

---

## y (with x)

### This example shows vertical offset for the extraction start point

```python
tx = ResizeAndCropTransforms().resize_and_crop(
    width=300,
    height=300,
    crop_mode=""extract"",
    x=100,
    y=300
)
```

---

## x_center (with y_center)

### This example shows extraction centered around a specific focal point

```python
tx = ResizeAndCropTransforms().resize_and_crop(
    width=300,
    height=300,
    crop_mode=""extract"",
    x_center=300,
    y_center=400
)
```

---

## y_center (with x_center)

### This example shows vertical center positioning for extraction

```python
tx = ResizeAndCropTransforms().resize_and_crop(
    width=300,
    height=300,
    crop_mode=""extract"",
    x_center=300,
    y_center=400
)
```

## DPR with width specified

### This example shows DPR applied to width-based resizing

```python
tx = ResizeAndCropTransforms().resize_and_crop(
    width=300,
    dpr=2
)
```

---

## DPR with height specified

### This example shows DPR applied to height-based resizing

```python
tx = ResizeAndCropTransforms().resize_and_crop(
    height=200,
    dpr=2
)
```

---

## DPR with both width and height

### This example shows DPR scaling both dimensions

```python
tx = ResizeAndCropTransforms().resize_and_crop(
    width=300,
    height=200,
    dpr=2
)
```

---

## DPR auto using client hints

### This example shows automatic DPR detection via request headers

```python
tx = ResizeAndCropTransforms().resize_and_crop(
    width=300,
    dpr=""auto""
)
```

---

## DPR ignored due to output size constraints

### This example shows DPR being ignored when output exceeds limits

```python
tx = ResizeAndCropTransforms().resize_and_crop(
    width=6000,
    dpr=2
)
```
